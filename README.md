This is a personal coding project for myself to practice coding and using discord.py. But also for fun to use for my friends and I in our discord servers.

Aspirational goals for this project is to have different sectors for the discord like an Economic sector, Casino sector, Moderation sector, etc. These will work hand in hand with each other and play a role in each others sector. 
So far implemented attributes are swear moderation and swear jar, basic honor system betting, and a few display commands. 

### Note
This is a work in progress and not close to completion.

**Project is still in alpha stages.**
